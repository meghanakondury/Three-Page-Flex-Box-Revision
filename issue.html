    <h2>Let's question the NORMAL</h2>
      <br>
  <p>We would be amazed to observe how certain things and behaviors that we consider ‘normal’ are not normal by nature but were taught to us intentionally or unintentionally as normal. Gender inequality and gender bias are topics that are widely discussed on many platforms around the world. But not many understand the true impact of unconscious gender bias in our lives. Numerous decisions and actions in our lives could be a result of the stereotypical notions we have in our minds. Why do many people consider these topics as alien topics that do not happen in our surroundings or households? How do these gender inequalities and biases form in our minds? </p>
  <br>
  <p>Parents are never biased with their children, so why do they assign different household chores to boys and girls? Stereotypical thinking is the origin of gender inequalities and biases. Stereotypes stand as one of the deep-rooted problems in our world which have various aspects like stereotype threat and stereotype lift. </p>
  <br>
  <p>In order to eradicate stereotypical mindsets and their origin, we need to start questioning the ‘normal’ and try to understand why we think, react and make decisions the way we do</p>
